  route: { id, routeNumber, routeName, ... },
  gps: {
    enabled: boolean,
    status: 'online' | 'recent' | 'offline',
    currentLocation: { latitude, longitude, speed, accuracy, ... },
    device: { id, name, status, lastHeartbeat }
  },
  estimatedArrival: {
    boardingStop: string,
    estimatedMinutes: number,
    estimatedTime: string,
    confidence: 'high' | 'medium' | 'low'
  }
}
```

#### **Route Progress API**
```typescript
GET /api/routes/route-progress?student_id={id}
GET /api/routes/route-progress?route_id={id}

Response:
{
  route: { id, routeNumber, routeName, ... },
  progress: {
    totalStops: number,
    completedStops: number,
    remainingStops: number,
    progressPercentage: number,
    currentStop: object,
    nextStop: object
  },
  stops: [ /* enhanced stops with completion status */ ],
  studentBoardingInfo: {
    stopName: string,
    stopTime: string,
    completed: boolean,
    current: boolean,
    upcoming: boolean,

- **Offline**: GPS not updated for more than 5 minutes

#### **Route Progress Algorithm**
1. **Distance Calculation**: Uses Haversine formula to calculate distances to stops
2. **Stop Completion Logic**: Determines completed stops based on time and proximity
3. **Progress Percentage**: Real-time calculation of journey completion
4. **Arrival Estimation**: Smart algorithms using speed and distance data

#### **Student-Specific Features**
- **Automatic Route Detection**: Finds student's allocated route from session
- **Boarding Point Matching**: Matches student's boarding point with route stops
- **Personalized Estimates**: Calculates arrival times specifically for student's stop
- **Contextual Information**: Shows how many stops until student's boarding point
