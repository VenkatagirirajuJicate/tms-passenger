✅ Parent app redirects back with authorization code
✅ JWT token received and validated successfully
```

**Console Evidence:**
```
"Auth callback successful, returning user: kumar_m@jkkn.ac.in"
"Validation result: {valid: true, user: {...}, session: {...}}"
```

### **2. Database Integration** ✅
```
✅ Parent app user integrated with TMS database
✅ New student record created automatically
✅ Roll number generated: PA038584F9
✅ Student ID assigned: cc628916-dc23-42f0-9ff3-be365853e3a8
```

**Console Evidence:**
```
"🔗 Integrating parent app user with database: kumar_m@jkkn.ac.in"
"✅ Successfully created new student: kumar_m@jkkn.ac.in"
"🆕 Created new student record: {studentId: 'cc628916-dc23-42f0-9ff3-be365853e3a8', email: 'kumar_m@jkkn.ac.in', rollNumber: 'PA038584F9'}"
```

### **3. Dashboard Access** ✅
```
✅ User redirected to dashboard
✅ Dashboard data fetched successfully
✅ Mock data generated for new user
✅ Transport enrollment system ready
```

**Console Evidence:**
```
"User already authenticated, redirecting..."
"📊 Dashboard fetching data for student: {studentId: 'cc628916-dc23-42f0-9ff3-be365853e3a8', email: 'kumar_m@jkkn.ac.in', isNewStudent: true, rollNumber: 'PA038584F9'}"
